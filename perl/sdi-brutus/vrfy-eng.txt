[Introduction]
`'`'`'`'`'`'`'
In the beginning when ideas were still  taking shape, the main  objective was to
show  how it would be possible to obtain rather easily a  SPAM LIST by using the
VRFY and EXPN commands.

As  a  result  of ongoing tests,  we discovered that  another technique could be
employed  -  other than the ones widely used    to  obtain a list of valid users
(directly linked to the SMTP Server being used) for future "BRUTE FORCE" attacks
and the godforsaken SPAM.

The technique is as follows:
[HELO] + [MAIL FROM:] + [RCPT TO:]



[Motivation]
`'`'`'`'`'`'
The main aim is to promote awareness among admins of mail servers regarding this
type  of  attack.  It  all  comes  to  show  that  even  by  following basic RFC
standart procedues  - without VRFY and EXPN - we can still list  the valid users
using by another command as suggested in [RFC821].



[Bug]
`'`'`
We  really  cannot  call  this a bug because  there are no restrictions on using
certain suggested commands.  Let's take an example such as VRFY and EXPN - these
commands exist to create client interaction and may or may not be implemented.

Let's observe  the  case  of  a basic command for SMTP protocol - the RCPT. This
command  is  used when defining the user's destination without any restrictions.
It's the same command used for CC's and BCC's. 

There  is a real good chance we can weaken "secure configurations"  of some SMTP
Servers(Sendmail - O PrivacyOptions=goaway).

In  our  tests  we  use  Sendmail  because its DSN(Delivery Status Notification)
follow patterns suggested in [RFC1893].Two other tests were performed with QMail
and  Checkpoint  FireWall-1  secure  SMTP  server.  These  two do not follow the
patterns suggested by the RFC due to security issues or  negligence.  Its not up
to us to pass judgement. 

But pay attention to what is suggested in [[RFC821]: 
[...]
   3.1.  MAIL

      There are three steps to SMTP mail transactions.  The transaction
      is started with a MAIL command which gives the sender
      identification.  A series of one or more RCPT commands follows
      giving the receiver information.  Then a DATA command gives the
      mail data.  And finally, the end of mail data indicator confirms
      the transaction.

         The first step in the procedure is the MAIL command.  The
         <reverse-path> contains the source mailbox.

            MAIL <SP> FROM:<reverse-path> <CRLF>

         This command tells the SMTP-receiver that a new mail
         transaction is starting and to reset all its state tables and
         buffers, including any recipients or mail data.  It gives the
         reverse-path which can be used to report errors.  If accepted,
         the receiver-SMTP returns a 250 OK reply.

         The <reverse-path> can contain more than just a mailbox.  The
         <reverse-path> is a reverse source routing list of hosts and
         source mailbox.  The first host in the <reverse-path> should be
         the host sending this command.

         The second step in the procedure is the RCPT command.

            RCPT <SP> TO:<forward-path> <CRLF>

         This command gives a forward-path identifying one recipient.
         If accepted, the receiver-SMTP returns a 250 OK reply, and
         stores the forward-path.  If the recipient is unknown the
         receiver-SMTP returns a 550 Failure reply.  This second step of
         the procedure can be repeated any number of times.
[...]

Compare with the test results obtained in the "Feedback" section. 



[The tests]
`'`'`'`'`'`
1) The first  test  performed  with a Server in which the VRFY and EXPN commands
had been enabled in its sendmail.cf, observe:

rewt:~/brute-force# smtp-cracker -h leet.eleet.org -i users -o primeiro.txt -v
connected to leet.eleet.org
using [VRFY] command
status: 100% \
found 6 users in 68 seconds
rewt:~/brute-force#


2) The  second  test  was  performed  with  a  Server in which the VRFY and EXPN
commands had been deactivated in its sendmail.cf, observe: 

rewt:~/brute-force# smtp-cracker -h leet.eleet.org -i users -o primeiro.txt -r
connected to leet.eleet.org
using [RCPT TO:] command
status: 100% \
found 6 users in 9 seconds
rewt:~/brute-force#


After both tests, we noticed  that  the "RCPT TO:" technique proved to be faster
than the first two techniques.



[Vulnerable]
`'`'`'`'`'`'
Among the SMTP Servers that we  tested the only one that was  vulnerable  to the
new technique employed was the Sendmail because it follows procedures  suggested
in [RFC821] and [RFC1893].

For further details go to "Feedback" section.



[Correction]
`'`'`'`'`'`'
(I) Sendmail
`'`'`'`'`'`'
In the  '/etc/sendmail.cf' file add the parameter to the "O" macro:
1) Disable the VRFY command:
"O PrivacyOptions=novrfy"

2) Disable the EXPN command:
"O PrivacyOptions=noexpn"

3)Disabling both:
"O PrivacyOptions=goaway"

4) Regarding the RCPT command, we suggest to modify and/or enable the macros:
"O MaxDaemonChildren=NN"
"O MaxRecipientsPerMessage=NN"
"O MaxQueueRunSize=NN"

(II) QMail e CheckPoint FireWall-1 secure SMTP server

We  were  not  able  to  use  this technique because it does not comply with RFC
standards. See the "FeedBack" section.



[Extras]
`'`'`'`'
We  advise  the  use  of  a  LOGS  checking  system  to visualize any attempt in
obtaining usernames by using this command.  Go to the following site:
http://www.psionic.com/abacus/logcheck/

Example of an output sent via email using the logcheck: 
Active System Attack Alerts
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Jan  8 21:58:41 null sendmail[30867]: NOQUEUE: null.localdomain.com 
[213.231.132.123]: VRFY attack?
Security Violations
=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=-=
Jan  8 21:58:41 null sendmail[30867]: NOQUEUE: null.localdomain.com 
[213.231.132.123]: vrfy usuario [rejected]

Another alternative would be to use IDS(Intrusion Detection System) by filtering
the VRFY and EXPN strings as well as some RCPT requests.
