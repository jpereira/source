The best try against a NIPS/NIDS is:
nng -d <address|name> --payload <pid> --flood --delay 0

If the NIPS/NIDS surveives after 1, 5 and 10 minutes, you can try the real
exploit against the target machine, because _sometimes_ the NIPS/NIDS will
not deal with all the packets and you can inject a _real attack_ without a
block/detection. That is the beaty in false-positive.
