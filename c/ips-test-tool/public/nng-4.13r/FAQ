Q. Why did you name the tool Numb?
A: Because I do like Linkin Park's Numb song.

Q. Is there a version to run on Win32?
A: YEAH!!! Are you happy, now?  The  Numb Project was finally *ported* to Win32
   environments using Cygwin32 (http://www.cygwin.com).

Q. Can I make joke with the Numb name, calling it DUMB?
A: Do whatever you want, and, in special, use the tool in case of need.
