Q. Why did you name the tool Encore?
A: Well, first tool (named Numb) was named due to the Linkin Park's song, and I
   could not leave out the Jay-Z duet with Linkin Park (Encore/Numb).  That  is
   the real reason.

Q. Is there a version to run on Win32?
A: YEAH!!! Are you happy, now? The Encore Project was finally *ported* to Win32
   environments using Cygwin32 (http://www.cygwin.com).
