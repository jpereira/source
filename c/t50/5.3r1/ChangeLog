Since the previous release  version (H2HC), some improvements were introduced
to this new version:
1. New License: It is, finally, licensed under GPL Version 2.0. Please, refer
   to LICENSE document for further information.

2. CIDR Support: Classless Inter-Domain Routing  support  for destination  IP
   address,  using  a  really  tiny  C  algorithm.  This would allow the  new
   version to simulate DDoS in a laboratory environment.

       [...]
 
       001 unsigned int hostid, counter, rand_addr;
       002 in_addr_t netmask, __1st_addr, addresses[16777214];
       003 struct iphdr *ip;

       010 netmask    = ~(0xffffffff>>bits);
       011 __1st_addr = (ntohl(address)&netmask)+1;
       012 hostid     = (1 << (32 - bits)) - 2;

       020 for(counter = 0 ; counter < hostid ; counter++)
       021       addresses[counter] = htonl(__1st_addr++);

       030 rand_daddr = ((float)(hostid)*rand()/(RAND_MAX+1.0));
       031 ip->daddr  = addresses[rand_daddr];

       [...]

3. ELEVEN NEW Protocols: ELEVEN (11) more protocols supported by T50:
    1. IGMPv3: Internet Group Message Protocol v3
    2. EGP:    Exterior Gateway Protocol
    3. RIPv1:  Routing Information Protocol v1
    4. RIPv2:  Routing Information Protocol v2
    5. DCCP:   Datagram Congestion Control Protocol
    6. RSVP:   Resource ReSerVation Protocol
    7. IPSec:  Internet Protocol Security (AH/ESP)
    8. GRE:    Generic Routing Encapsulation
    9. EIGRP:  Enhanced Interior Gateway Routing Protocol
   10. OSPF:   Open Shortest Path First

4. Exotic Protocols: Advanced options and protocol crafting for RSVP,  EIGRP,
   OSPF and GRE were added,  allowing  users  to  make  any combination while
   using those exotic protocols.  By the way, EIGRP is a proprietary protocol 
   developed by CISCO Systems, Inc.

5. Encapsulation: T50 is capable now to encapsulate all its packet within the
   Generic Routing Encapsulation, making it the most powerful tool ever.

6. TCP Options Support: TCP  Options  are  now  supported  to improve the TCP
   protocol, such as:
    1. TCP End of Option List (RFC 793)
    2. TCP No-Operation Option (RFC 793)
    3. TCP Maximum Segment Size Option (RFC 793)
    4. TCP Window Scale Option (RFC 1323)
    5. TCP Timestamps Option (RFC 1323)
    6. T/TCP Connection Count Option (RFC 1644)
    7. T/TCP CC.NEW Option (RFC 1644)
    8. T/TCP CC.ECHO Option (RFC 1644)
    9. TCP SACK-Permitted Option (RFC 2018)
   10. TCP Selective Acknowledgement Option (RFC 2018)
   11. TCP MD5 Signature Option (RFC 2385)
   12. TCP Authentication Option (RFC 5925)

This changes are not limited to the list  above,  but I  do not have time  to
write a complete set of improvements, so, please, if you  really want to know
the complete list of changes, execute the command:
