Kids are always kids...

The T50 has been released with some "locks" within its code in order to limit the stress-testing only on private IP addresses (a.k.a. "RFC1700/1918/3330" compliance). But it didn't take so long to kids do what they do, and they removed lines from "check.c", but, hey kids, you didn't need to remove the lines from "check.c", you just needed to comment the "DFLAGS += -D__HAVE_LIMITATION__" line in the "Makefile".

As I said, kids are always kids...
